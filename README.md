## About this Project ##

Console- and Window-Project to solve Modules of the Game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"

### Why tho? ###

I had problems wrapping my Head around one specific Module (The one with 5 letters, where only one word of a list fits).
So I thought I could write a little Program to solve this specific Module.

Since I'm a bit of an over-achiever and this little program was easier than expected, I started this project to further
improve my coding-skills and maybe help someone else with this specific Issue.

## What can it do? ##

_(Besides ruining the Game)_

### ConsoleDefuser ###

- For those who don't need much
- Runs in a simple Console
- Easier to implement
- Used for development
- Should be more Lightweight than GUI
- Ruins the game

### WindowDefuser ###

- _Not Implemented Yet_
- Nicer Look & Feel
- Defies the purpose of the Game completely

### BombDefuser ###

- Contains Game-Logic
- Contains Interface for decoupling UI and I/O

## What needs to be done? ##

- Localisation _(messed up some english/german already, sorry)_
    - Easy expandable Localisation-Files
- More Modules
    - Besides the Password-Module (#11), none are implemented
- GUI
    - I haven't even started with that
